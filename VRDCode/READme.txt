The file Sequence_map.csv contains the mapping of Video IDs to the trajectories in the sequence.
The raw discomfort scores and Z-scores are stored in the files scores.mat and zscores.mat respectively. The code for generating this data from the files in StudyData is in the file 'full_ratings.m'.
The discomfort prediction for both the average user as well as the user-specific case is computed using the regmodel.m file by setting flag values to 1 and 2 respectively.
For the user-specific case, the number of training videos can be specified by changing the value of the variable 'tvNum'.
The StudyData folder needs to be downloaded from the repository and placed in the Data folder.
