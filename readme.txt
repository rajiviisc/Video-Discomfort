Video Discomfort in Virtual Reality Dataset

This dataset consists of:
1. Blender files containing the mapped camera trajectories that were rendered to generate the final videos
2. Discomfort scores provided by subjects after watching the videos

Additional Details

The ‘Blender’ folder contains .blend files corresponding to 10 indoor and 10 outdoor scenes in the ‘Indoor’ and ‘Outdoor’ sub-folders respectively. These files were generated after mapping specific trajectories from different datasets to individual scenes in the files. Camera trajectories were modified using Blender parameters to generate the final sequences contained in the files. 

The ‘discomfortData’ file contains the sequence of videos watched by each subject during the study as well as the corresponding discomfort scores given by the subject.
